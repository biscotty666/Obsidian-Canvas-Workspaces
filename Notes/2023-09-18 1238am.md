# Content
This is interesting because it makes me think of something else.

Gascon-speaking communities were called in for trading purposes by Navarrese kings in the early 12th century to the coastal fringe extending from [San Sebastian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n "San Sebastián") to the river [Bidasoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidasoa "Bidasoa"), where they settled down. The language variant used was different from the ones used in Navarre, i.e. a [Béarnese dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9arnese_dialect "Béarnese dialect") of Gascon,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language#cite_note-dialnet.unirioja.es-37) with Gascon being in use far longer than in Navarre and Aragon until the 19th century, thanks mainly to the close ties held by Donostia and [Pasaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasaia "Pasaia") with [Bayonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne "Bayonne").
