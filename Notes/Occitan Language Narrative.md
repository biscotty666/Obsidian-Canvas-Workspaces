# The Occitan Language
When living in Switzerland I visited southern France with some frequency. On these trips, I discovered that a language other than French was spoken there, and that the name "Provence" carried more than simply the geographical significance, but linguistic as well. 

The linguistic significance of the neighboring province's name, Langue d'Oc, is more obvious. This lead to a discovery of the linguistic, north/south split between the [[Langues d'Oc]] and the [[Langues d'o√Øl]].
