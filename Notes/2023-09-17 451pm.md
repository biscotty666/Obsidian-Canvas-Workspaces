# Content
Occitan was seen as a political threat in France, but at least for a time, it was a status language in Spain.
# Reference
The language in turn became the status language chosen by the Navarrese kings, nobility, and upper classes for official and trade purposes in the period stretching from the early 13th century to late 14th century.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language#cite_note-32) These boroughs in Navarre may have been close-knit communities with little intermingling, in a context where the natural milieu was predominantly [Basque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language "Basque language")-speaking. The variant chosen for written administrative records was a _[koiné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koin%C3%A9_language "Koiné language")_ based on the Languedocien dialect from Toulouse with fairly archaic linguistic features.
