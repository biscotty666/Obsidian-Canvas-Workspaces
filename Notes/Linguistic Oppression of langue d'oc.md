# Content
Occitan began to suffer [[Linguistic Oppression]] (cf. [[Basque Language]]) in the 14th century as the Kingdom of France gradually became dominant in the South.

In 1539 the langue d'oil was decreed the official language for all French administration.

During the [[French Revolution]], diversity of languages was considered a threat.
