## Occitan in the Americas
Occitan is spoken in Valdese, [[North Carolina]], [[Qubec]], Pigue, [[Argentina]] and [[Guanajuato]]. 

In [[Mexico]] they are called Barcelonettes. They emigrated to Mexico in the 19th and early 20th Century. The number of immigrants seems to have been exagerated according to this article (Siller, Javier Pérez. ["De mitos y realidades: la emigracíon barcelonette a México 1845–1891"](http://www.mexicofrancia.org/articulos/p17.pdf))
